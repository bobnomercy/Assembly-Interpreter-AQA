# Assembly-Interpreter-AQA
An unofficial interpreter for AQA assembly code


for complete instruction set:

This is a basic interpreter using instruction set of the AQA exam.
There is minimal syntax checking, but the debug info gives information that can be used to find issues.
If you do find any issues, you can create an issue on Github, or email me directly.
